This is a mini game project based on pure javaScript.<br>
<br>
(1) The game has 2 players, playing in rounds<br>
(2) In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score<br>
(3) BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn<br>
(4) The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn<br>
(5) The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game<br>
